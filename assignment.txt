Create a script called edit_metadata.py

In the script:

    Read in the csv file victorian_serial_novels_unedited.csv

    In the genre column 
    - change all occurences of "book" to the AAT value "books"

    In the resource_type column
    - capitalize the first letter in "text" so it becomes "Text"

    In the related url column
    - change the format of the url from
      http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=394452
      to 
      http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=394452

      using the id from incorrect url


    Output the modified file to victorian_serial_novels_edited.csv
